# MemeMe

Meme is an image processing app that allows users to create, share and download custom memes on their phone. This project helped me build a strong foundation in UIKit. It helped me get comfortable with navigation controllers, tab bar controllers, table views, collection views, image upload, camera access, and much more. This helped set the groundwork for more complex projects down the line.
